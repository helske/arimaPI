Description: Bayesian prediction intervals for ARIMA processes and structural time series with exogenous variables which take account the parameter uncertainty, leading to more accurate coverage probabilities in frequentist sense. Package uses computationally efficient importance sampling and root solving based on the predicted values and prediction errors, allowing computation of standard errors for prediction limits.
